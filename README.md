# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This dataset is one of the most popular and widely used datasets. Anomaly detection problems can be solved using different models and techniques. Following are details of this project including all information needed to get started.

## Introduction

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. I will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.

Please note in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons.

## Approach

* Understand the distribution of of our dataset.
* Create a balanced dataframe of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions.
* Decide which Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
* create a pipleine to test and compare the accuracy to our best classifier.
* Understand common mistaked made with imbalanced datasets.
