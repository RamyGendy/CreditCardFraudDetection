## Introduction

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. I will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.

Please note in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons.

## Approach

* Understand the distribution of of our dataset.
* Create a balanced dataframe of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions.
* Decide which Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
* Create a pipleine to test and compare the accuracy to our best classifier.
* Understand common mistaked made with imbalanced datasets.
